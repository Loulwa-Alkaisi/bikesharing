### Story:

The first and last pages of the story showcase the starting and ending locations. The bigger and darker the circles means that these locations have more traffic than the rest. 

The second and third story pages showcase the trip durations that the users take in general and based on their gender. From the data we can see that the majority of the users use the bikes for an hour or less and male users bike more than other genders.

The rest of the pages show the usage of the bikes based on the gender and the days of the week. Based on that data we can see that the bikes are mostly used between 6:00 - 9:00 am and 5:00 - 8:00 pm Monday to Friday.

## ***Summary:***
Wether it's which starting and ending locations are mostly used or what times of day the users ride bikes the most and for how long, these visualizations allowed us to understand the users more and gave us a better insight on our data.
